NAME
    Dancer2::Plugin::ControllerAutoload - Autoload controllers

SYNOPSIS
    When we "use" the plugin in MyApp.pm it'll load all the controllers
    under the "Controller" directory, so you don't have to write one "use
    $controller" in MyApp.pm for each controller.

        # MyApp.pm
        package MyApp;
        use Dancer2;
        use Dancer2::Plugin::ControllerAutoload;

        # MyApp/Controller/Users.pm
        package MyApp::Controller::Users;
        use Dancer2 appname => 'MyApp';

        # MyApp/Controller/Users/Thoughts.pm
        package MyApp::Controller::Users::Thoughts;
        use Dancer2 appname => 'MyApp';

DESCRIPTION
    If you have these three controllers

        # MyApp/Controller/Users.pm
        package MyApp::Controller::Users;
        use Dancer2 appname => 'MyApp';

        # MyApp/Controller/Users/Thoughts.pm
        package MyApp::Controller::Users::Thoughts;
        use Dancer2 appname => 'MyApp';

        # MyApp/Controller/Services.pm
        package MyApp::Controller::Services;
        use Dancer2 appname => 'MyApp';

    you'd have to load each with an "use"

        # MyApp.pm
        package MyApp;
        use Dancer2;
        use MyApp::Controller::Users;
        use MyApp::Controller::Users::Thoughts;
        use MyApp::Controller::Services;

    This plugin simplifies this process. When you "use" the plugin, all
    controllers will be loaded.

        # MyApp.pm
        package MyApp;
        use Dancer2;
        use Dancer2::Plugin::ControllerAutoload;

    A controller will be by default identified as such if it is under the
    "Controller" directory. But that's configurable. If your controller
    directory is called "Contr":

        # in a config or environment file
        plugins:
            ControllerAutoload:
                controller_dir: Contr
